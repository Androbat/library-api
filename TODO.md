# Change to watch and run command configuration to do all in one using nodemon
- I have to change the configuration to admit nodemon with typescript and node.js. 
  Since now I'm not able to compile and run the app at the same time. As part of the current process,
  have to first compile the project and then run it. Every time I make a change, have to do this all again.
  Therefore, can be automated.
